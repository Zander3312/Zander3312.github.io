        Hi, I'm Zander. I've been passionate about
        Computer Science since I was young, being very interested in how the technology around me works and developing my interests using
        hobbies like video games as inspiration. My first exposure to programming was using Scratch in 5th grade, and ever since then
        I've never lost my passion for coding and Computer Science. I am proficient in Python, Java, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
